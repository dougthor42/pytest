pytest with enhancements
========================

This is a fork of pytest with enhancements that have been rejected upstream,
have stalled there, or are not really fitting.

This is mainly for getting things done, and having things here that I like better.

I have started with https://github.com/blueyed/pytest-enhancements, but figured
that it is more sane to have a personal fork than a plugin that has to
monkeypatch pytest anyway.

It also allows for having CI etc (in contrast to having this only in a local
integration branch).

The ``pytest`` framework makes it easy to write small tests, yet
scales to support complex functional testing for applications and libraries.

An example of a simple test:

.. code-block:: python

    # content of test_sample.py
    def inc(x):
        return x + 1


    def test_answer():
        assert inc(3) == 5


To execute it::

    $ pytest
    ============================= test session starts =============================
    collected 1 items

    test_sample.py F

    ================================== FAILURES ===================================
    _________________________________ test_answer _________________________________

        def test_answer():
    >       assert inc(3) == 5
    E       assert 4 == 5
    E        +  where 4 = inc(3)

    test_sample.py:5: AssertionError
    ========================== 1 failed in 0.04 seconds ===========================


Due to ``pytest``'s detailed assertion introspection, only plain ``assert`` statements are used. See `getting-started <https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/getting-started.html#our-first-test-run>`_ for more examples.
